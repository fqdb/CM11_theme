#About

This project is about making EMUI 3.0 look like Cyanogenmod 11 (CM11) within all the limitations that Huawei has restricted EMUI to. In other words, a CM11 theme for EMUI 3.0. The device I use is a Huawei Ascend P7, so all resources are xxhdpi/1080p

#Documentation
Documentation that I've found can be found in the Documentation folder and on the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://fqdb.github.io/page/cm11_theme_for_huawei_emui_30.html">project homepage</a>.
