#About

This project is about making EMUI look like CM11 within all the limitations that Huawei has restricted EMUI to.

##Documentation
Documentation that I've found can be found in the Documentation folder.

Some things that weren't in there but are good to know:
* the 'framework-res-hwext' folder should be compressed to a zip file and renamed to not include an extension in the final theme.
